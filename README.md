# Solving the Stochastic Growth Model via Value Function Iteration.  
Our task was to solve the stochastic growth model with non-negative investment via value function iteration.  
In the [report](report.pdf), a brief description of the model will be given, followed by the applied methods carried out for the computational analyses.  
The economic as well as the computational aspects of the kink complete the report.  
Value function iteration is one of the most important and known methods in order to solve Dynamic General Equilibrium models.  
In this paper, we use the value function iteration (VFI) to solve the stochastic growth model with non-negative investment constraint, that is described by Heer and Maussnerin their book “Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling”.  
First, we will introduce the standard Ramsey economy and discuss the underlying idea of it.  
Secondly, we will move from the deterministic to the stochastic growth model with non-negative investments and solvethe problem via VFI.  
The next chapter explains some of the relevant functions that have been used for the simulation of the mentioned model.  
Lastly, we will discuss the computational as well as the economic aspects of the kink.
